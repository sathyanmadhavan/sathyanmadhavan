### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ this is Sathyan

I am recent graduate in Bsc Computer Science looking for opportunities and collobration in projects related to python.

-  ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Qxf2 as Software Engineer,Intern.
- I do have Certificates in Java and Git.
- Skills - Core Java,Python,MySQL,Git,Selenium,pytest,HTML,CSS.

- I do have an idea of creating a webapplication which helps the final year students to choose a project where they can learn about that and even they can get the source
code of the project.
- But the problem is I am not so familar with Javascript so if someone knows Javascript and wishes to work with me
- You can visit this site http://sathyanmadhavan.pythonanywhere.com/ and contact me
- This site was created as a motive to represent my online resume. I used flask framework for creating this site and hosted it through `pythonanywhere`.
- I love to learn new things and eager to create more web  applications
